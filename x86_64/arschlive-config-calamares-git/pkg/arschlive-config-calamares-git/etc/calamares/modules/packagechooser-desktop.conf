# Configuration for the low-density software chooser
---
# Software selection mode, to set whether the software packages
# can be chosen singly, or multiply.
#
# Possible modes are "optional", "required" (for zero-or-one or exactly-one)
# or "optionalmultiple", "requiredmultiple" (for zero-or-more
# or one-or-more).
mode: required

# Software installation method:
#
# - "legacy" or "custom" or "contextualprocess"
#   When set to "legacy", writes a GlobalStorage value for the choice that
#   has been made. The key is *packagechooser_<id>*. The module's
#   instance name is used; see the *instances* section of `settings.conf`.
#   If there is just one packagechooser module, and no special instance is set,
#   resulting GS key is probably *packagechooser_packagechooser*.
#
#   The GS value is a comma-separated list of the IDs of the selected
#   packages, or an empty string if none is selected.
#
#   With "legacy" installation, you should have a contextualprocess or similar
#   module somewhere in the `exec` phase to process the GlobalStorage key
#   and actually **do** something for the packages.
#
# - "packages"
#   When set to "packages", writes GlobalStorage values suitable for
#   consumption by the *packages* module (which should appear later
#   in the `exec` section. These package settings will then be handed
#   off to whatever package manager is configured there.
#
# - "netinstall-select"
#   When this is set, the id(s) selected are passed to the netinstall module.
#   Any id that matches a group name in that module is set to checked
#
# - "netinstall-add"
#   With this method, the packagechooser module is used to add groups to the
#   netinstall module.  For this to have any effect.  You must set netinstall,
#   which is described below.
#
# There is no need to put this module in the `exec` section. There
# are no jobs that this module provides. You should put **other**
# modules, either *contextualprocess* or *packages* or some custom
# module, in the `exec` section to do the actual work.
method: netinstall-add


# Human-visible strings in this module. These are all optional.
# The following translated keys are used:
#  - *step*, used in the overall progress view (left-hand pane)
#
# Each key can have a [locale] added to it, which is used as
# the translated string for that locale. For the strings
# associated with the "no-selection" item, see *items*, below
# with the explicit item-*id* "".
